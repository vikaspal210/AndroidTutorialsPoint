Services
A service is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations without needing to interact with 
the user and it works even if application is destroyed. A service can essentially take two states âˆ’

Started

A service is started when an application component, such as an activity, starts it by calling startService(). 
Once started, a service can run in the background indefinitely, even if the component that started it is destroyed.

Bound

A service is bound when an application component binds to it by calling bindService(). A bound service offers a client-server 
interface that allows components to interact with the service, send requests, get results, and even do so across processes
with interprocess communication (IPC).

Methods:
onStartCommand()

The system calls this method when another component, such as an activity, requests that the service be started,
by calling startService(). If you implement this method, it is your responsibility to stop the service when its work is done, 
by calling stopSelf() or stopService() methods.

onBind()

The system calls this method when another component wants to bind with the service by calling bindService().
If you implement this method, you must provide an interface that clients use to communicate with the service,
by returning an IBinder object.
You must always implement this method, but if you don't want to allow binding, then you should return null.
